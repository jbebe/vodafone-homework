## Work log

1. Created a git(hub) repo
2. Set the basic structure by creating a server and client folder
3. Picked NestJS as the framework because 
   * it has a slightly bigger marketshare than Express
   * compared to Express, has better DX, less boilerplate
   * core behavior can be delegated to Express, Fastify, etc.
